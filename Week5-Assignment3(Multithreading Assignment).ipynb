    "### Q1. What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer -**\n",
    "**Multithreading** is a way of achieving multitasking. In multithreading, the concept of threads are used. A thread is a sequence of such instructions within a program that can be executed independently of other code. Multihreading tries to create multiple threads or subprocesses of the same program within one core of processor and execute it. Thus, in threading, we can collect all the resources within a core and execute a program. \n",
    "\n",
    "By using multiplethreading, we can optimise a single core/processor and perform multiple tasks. Multithreading allows many parts of a program to run simultaneously. These parts are referred to as threads, and they are lightweight processes that are available within the process. As a result, multithreading increases CPU utilization through multitasking. In multithreading, a computer may execute and process multiple tasks simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle threads in python, one needs to import module **threading**"
