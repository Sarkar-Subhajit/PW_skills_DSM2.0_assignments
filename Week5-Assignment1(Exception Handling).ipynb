    "### Q1. What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer -**\n",
    "Error in Python can be of two types - Syntax errors and Exceptions. An **exception** is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. Exceptions are raised when some internal events occur which change the normal flow of the program. Exceptions are raised when the program is syntactically correct, but the code results in an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **syntax error** occurs when the structure of a program does not conform to the rules of the programming language. Syntax errors are usually detected by the compiler or interpreter when the program is being compiled or executed, and they prevent the program from running. Syntax errors are usually caused by mistakes in the source code, such as typos, omissions, or incorrect use of syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **exception** is an abnormal event that occurs during the execution of a program. Exceptions are usually caused by runtime errors, such as dividing by zero or trying to access a file that does not exist. Exceptions are not syntax errors, but they can still prevent the program from running if they are not handled properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, a syntax error is a mistake in the structure of the program that prevents it from running, while an exception is an abnormal event that occurs during the execution of the program and can be handled to allow the program to continue running."

    "### Q2. What happens when an exception is not handled? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer -**\n",
    "Whenever there is an error in a program (not syntax errors), exceptions are raised. If these exceptions are not handled, it drives the program into a halt state. Exception handling in python is required to prevent the program from terminating abruptly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following example where we try to divide two numbers by defining a function and at the end of it, will print a statement. Now if we set a = 2 and b = 0, the function will return error. This error is ZeroDivisionError. This is an exception. Because of this error, the python compiler will stop and not execute the further statements`print(\"This is the end of my function\")`. \n",
    "\n",
    "To counter this, we use exception handling techniques by using try-except block."

    "### Q5. What are Custom Exceptions in python? Why do we need Custom Exceptions? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer -**\n",
    "In Python, a custom exception is a user-defined exception that is created by the programmer to handle specific error scenarios in a program. A custom exception is made by subclassing the built-in Exception class or any of its subclasses accordng to the problem. When a custom exception is raised, it behaves like any other exception in Python, triggering an error message and terminating the program if it is not handled properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom exceptions provides a user the flexibility to add attributes and methods that otherwise, are not part of a standard python exception. These can store additional information or provide utility methods that can be used to handle or present the exception to a user. Thus, a custom exception, tailored to a specific use case can raise and catch specific circumstances that can make a program much more readable and robust, and reduce the amount of code one write later to try and figure out what exactly went wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we define a program that takes input height of a person and prints it. If one inputs the height in negative, the program will print the negative height. But in real life, height cannot be negative. Hence, here we make a custom exception, that will give us an error message to input positive height. The code to create a custom exception of this problem is given in Q6 solutions. "

    "**Answer -**\n",
    "The process of creating a custom exception is by creating a class and then importing the properties of Exception class into it by using Inheritance method. By this, all the characteristics/ variables/ functions are inherited into the custom exception class. One can then use this class, while defining a function, to program the conditions for solving the problem in an user-defined manner. Finally, the programmer can set this function under try block and the class under except block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the above example of inputing height of an individual. We create a custom exception class `validateheight` by inheriting Exception class to it that has an constructor variable message. We then define a function `validate_height` that takes height as input. As per our situation, if height is negative, it should give an error message to rectify the height into positive number. Thus we code the situtation that when height is less than 0, the function will raise (used to stop the flow of program and bring up the current exception) the custom exception class validateage and print the message ***\"Height should not be negative\"***. Else it will print the height of the person if no exception(height in negative) is raised. At last, we take user defined height as input and run it through the function validate_height, both kept under the ***try block***. We also keep the custom exception class and to print the exception under ***except block***. "
