    "## Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer -**\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL(Not Only SQL) database that stores large scale of data in flexible, JSON-like documents called BSON(Binary JSON) and allow us to work with that data efficiently. It is designed to provide high performance, scalability, and flexibility for modern applications that require dynamic, complex data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL or Not Only SQL databases, are databases that do not use the traditional table-based relational database model used in SQL databases. Instead, they use flexible data models that can handle large amount of semi-structured and unstructured data such as key-value, document-oriented, or graph-based, making them ideal for handling big data and real-time data processing. They can be more flexible and scalable than traditional SQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Flexibility and scalability are important**: MongoDB is designed to be flexible and scalable, making it a good choice for handling large and complex data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Agile development**: MongoDB's flexible schema allows for more agile and iterative development, as changes can be made to the database schema without requiring a complete redesign of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Big Data and real-time analytics**: MongoDB is well-suited for big data and real-time analytics, as it can easily handle unstructured and semi-structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cloud-based applications**: MongoDB is often used for cloud-based applications, as it can easily scale to meet the demands of a growing user base.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Geospatial data**: MongoDB has built-in support for geospatial data, making it a popular choice for applications that involve location-based services."

    "## Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer -**\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database that provides a wide range of features that make it a popular choice for modern application development. In MongoDB, data is organized into a hierarchy of **databases, collections, and documents**. A **database** is a container for a set of collections, each with its own set of documents. In MongoDB, you can have multiple databases within a single MongoDB server instance. A **collection** is a group of MongoDB documents, similar to a table in a relational database. Collections are used to group related documents together and typically have a common schema, although MongoDB's flexible document model allows for some variation within a collection. Each collection within a MongoDB database is given a unique name that is used to identify and access the collection. A **document** is a set of key-value pairs that is stored within a collection. In MongoDB, a document is similar to a record in a relational database, but it is stored in a flexible and dynamic format known as BSON (Binary JSON). Each document can have its own unique structure and can include nested sub-documents and arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some important features of MongoDB are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Document-based data model**: MongoDB stores data in documents, which are similar to JSON objects. This allows for a flexible and scalable data model that can easily handle complex data structures.\n",
    "* **Scalability**: MongoDB is highly scalable and can handle large amounts of data and traffic with ease. It supports sharding, which allows you to distribute data across multiple servers for improved performance and availability.\n",
    "* **High availability**: MongoDB provides automatic failover and replica sets to ensure that your data is always available, even in the event of hardware or network failures.\n",
    "* **Flexible schema**: MongoDB has a flexible schema, which means that you can easily modify your data model as your application evolves.\n",
    "* **Rich query language**: MongoDB provides a powerful and flexible query language that allows you to perform complex queries on your data.\n",
    "* **Aggregation framework**: MongoDB provides a built-in aggregation framework that allows you to perform complex data processing tasks such as grouping, filtering, and transforming data.\n",
    "* **Geospatial support**: MongoDB provides built-in support for geospatial data, allowing you to easily perform queries based on location.\n",
    "* **Full-text search**: MongoDB provides full-text search capabilities that allow you to perform text-based searches on your data.\n",
    "* **ACID transactions**: MongoDB supports ACID transactions, allowing you to perform multiple operations on your data as a single, atomic transaction."
